# meshLights

Wifi connected (meshed) ESP32 nodes with synchronized animation effects.
 
This adds leader election, display/effect logic, additional messaging functionality and error checking to the amazing PainlessMesh and FastLED projects for the sake of keeping LED strands in sync across a mesh. Some of the initial idea was based on FastLED 100 line "demo reel" and LED_Synch_Mesh_Send by Carl F Sutter (2017)
