# meshLights

meshLights are wifi-connected ESP32 nodes with flexible LED effects. Supports up to 6 nodes, with automatic leader election and synchronization of LED animation. Leverages FastLED and PainlessMesh projects, and adds leader election, display/effect logic, additional messaging functionality and error checking.
